### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `N`. You have to return a pattern of `N` lines such that:

* The first line contains `N` stars (`*`)
* The second line contains `N - 1` stars
* …
* The `N`-th line contains 1 star

---

# Intuition

The number of stars (`*`) on each line decreases by one from top to bottom.

If `N = 5`, the expected output is:

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

So the pattern is simply:

* Line 1 → `N` stars
* Line 2 → `N - 1` stars
* Line 3 → `N - 2` stars
  ...
* Line `N` → `1` star

---

# Approach

1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store each line of the pattern.
2. Use a loop from `i = 0` to `i < N`.
3. On each iteration:
   * Calculate how many stars to add → `N - i`
   * Create a string of `N - i` stars using string repeat method.
   * Push the string into the result array.
4. Return the result array.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(N²)`
  * Because in each line `i`, we generate a string of length `N - i` which takes `O(N - i)` time. Summing this over all `i` from `0` to `N - 1` gives `O(N²)`.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(N²)`
  * Because we're storing `N` strings of decreasing lengths, with a total character count of roughly `N * (N + 1) / 2`.

# Code

```typescript
function printPatt(n: number): string[] {
    const pattern: string[] = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const stars = '*'.repeat(n - i);
        pattern.push(stars);
    }

    return pattern;
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

### Example:

```text
Input: n = 4
```

### Steps:

* i = 0 → `'*'.repeat(4 - 0) = '****'`
* i = 1 → `'*'.repeat(4 - 1) = '***'`
* i = 2 → `'*'.repeat(4 - 2) = '**'`
* i = 3 → `'*'.repeat(4 - 3) = '*'`

### Output:

```typescript
["****", "***", "**", "*"]
```

---

### **Summary**

* The pattern is generated by decreasing the number of stars in each line.
* The logic is straightforward using a loop and string repeat.
* The TypeScript implementation is clean, readable, and efficient for the given constraints.
