# Intuition

The **Look-and-Say sequence** is built by *reading the previous term aloud*:

* You “say” what you “see”.
* Each group of identical digits is replaced with:

  * The **count** of digits.
  * Followed by the **digit itself**.

---

# Approach

1. Start with the base case `term = "1"`.
2. For each iteration (from 2 to n):

   * Initialize `nextTerm` as an empty string.
   * Traverse the current term.
   * Count consecutive same digits.
   * Append `count + digit` to `nextTerm` whenever a new digit starts.
3. At the end of each iteration, update `term` with `nextTerm`.

---

# Time Complexity

* Each term is generated by traversing the previous term once.
* Length grows roughly by 30% each iteration.
* For `n ≤ 40`, this is easily within limits.

**Time:** O(K × N), where K is average term length
**Space:** O(K)

# Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public static String lookAndSaySequence(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return "1";

        String term = "1";

        // Generate terms iteratively up to n
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            StringBuilder nextTerm = new StringBuilder();

            int count = 1;
            char prev = term.charAt(0);

            // Traverse current term and build the next term
            for (int j = 1; j < term.length(); j++) {
                char curr = term.charAt(j);
                if (curr == prev) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    nextTerm.append(count).append(prev);
                    prev = curr;
                    count = 1;
                }
            }

            // Append last group
            nextTerm.append(count).append(prev);

            term = nextTerm.toString();
        }

        return term;
    }
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `n = 6`

| Step | Term   | Description             |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| 1    | 1      | Starting term           |
| 2    | 11     | One 1                   |
| 3    | 21     | Two 1s                  |
| 4    | 1211   | One 2, One 1            |
| 5    | 111221 | One 1, One 2, Two 1s    |
| 6    | 312211 | Three 1s, Two 2s, One 1 |

**Output:** `"312211"`
