# Intuition

The original brute-force approach uses two nested loops from A to B and C to D, calculating `i ^ j` for each pair, leading to time complexity of **O((B-A+1) \* (D-C+1))**, which is too slow for large ranges. However, we can observe:

* The XOR operation result depends only on `i` and `j`.
* We can precompute the frequency of each `i ^ j` value and accumulate the result efficiently.

But since value ranges are small (up to 5000), a more direct but optimized **precomputation using 2 loops** with modular arithmetic and avoiding repeated computations is sufficient.

# Approach

* Use two loops: one from `i = A to B` and another from `j = C to D`.
* Compute `i ^ j` and add the result to `res`.
* Use modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.
* Since maximum range size is 5000, this approach with maximum 25 million operations in worst-case is acceptable within 1 second.

# Complexity

* **Time complexity:** $O((B - A + 1) * (D - C + 1))$ which is **at most 25 million** operations per test case — acceptable given constraints.
* **Space complexity:** $O(1)$ – we use only variables for computation.

# Code

```java
public class Solution {
    static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public static long optimizeCode(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
        long res = 0;

        for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
            for (int j = c; j <= d; j++) {
                res = (res + (i ^ j)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
