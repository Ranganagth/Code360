# Intuition:

We need to send exactly **N** people to **City A** and **N** people to **City B** at **minimum total cost**.
For each person `i`, we are given two costs: `costToA` and `costToB`.

---

# Approcah:

If we **initially assume** everyone goes to **City A**, then for each person, we can calculate:

```java
costDifference = costToB - costToA
```

* A **positive** difference means it is more expensive to send them to City B.
* A **negative** difference means it's **cheaper** to send them to City B.

So we:
1. Assume everyone is going to City A
2. Pick **N people** with the **lowest costDifference** to be **sent to City B instead**
   * This minimizes total cost.

---

# Approach:

1. Start by adding all `costToA` to total cost.
2. Calculate the cost difference `costToB - costToA` for each person.
3. Sort the list by cost difference.
4. Pick **N smallest differences** and add them to the base total cost (because we're switching those people to City B).

---
# Complexity:

* **Time**: `O(N log N)` due to sorting `2N` elements
* **Space**: `O(N)` for the difference array

---

# Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
	public static int findMinCost(int n, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> cost) {
		int totalCost = 0;
		int totalPeople = 2 * n;

		// Store differences and assume all go to A
		int[] diff = new int[totalPeople];
		for (int i = 0; i < totalPeople; i++) {
			int costToA = cost.get(i).get(0);
			int costToB = cost.get(i).get(1);
			totalCost += costToA;
			diff[i] = costToB - costToA;
		}

		// Sort the cost differences
		Arrays.sort(diff);

		// Pick N people with smallest difference to go to B instead
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			totalCost += diff[i];  // This effectively adjusts A→B for i-th person
		}

		return totalCost;
	}
}
```

### **Example:**

Input:

```
N = 2
cost = [[5, 100], [50, 10], [10, 200], [100, 20]]
```

Assume all go to **City A**:
Total A cost = 5 + 50 + 10 + 100 = 165
Differences (B - A): `[95, -40, 190, -80]` → sorted: `[-80, -40, 95, 190]`
Pick smallest two: `-80`, `-40` → Add to total: `165 - 80 - 40 = 45`

Output = `45`
