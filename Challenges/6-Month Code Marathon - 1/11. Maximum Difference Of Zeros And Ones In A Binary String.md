# Intuition

We are asked to find the maximum difference between the number of zeros (`0`) and ones (`1`) in any substring. To simplify the problem, we treat:

* Each `0` as **+1** (since we want to maximize 0s)
* Each `1` as **-1** (since we want to minimize 1s)

Now, the problem becomes equivalent to **finding the maximum sum of a subarray** in the transformed array (Kadane’s Algorithm). This approach ensures that we always find the substring with the highest excess of `0`s over `1`s.

# Approach

1. Convert the binary string into an integer array:

   * Replace `'0'` with `+1`
   * Replace `'1'` with `-1`
2. Apply **Kadane’s Algorithm** to find the **maximum subarray sum**.
   * Initialize `maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE`, `currentSum = 0`
   * Iterate through the array:
     * `currentSum += value`
     * If `currentSum > maxSum`, update `maxSum`
     * If `currentSum < 0`, reset `currentSum` to `0`
3. If the maximum difference is less than or equal to `0`, return `0` (as difference can't be negative in this context).

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(N)
  (Each character is visited once per test case)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  (Only constant space used apart from input)

# Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static int maximumDifference(String str) {
        int maxDiff = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int current = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            int val = (str.charAt(i) == '0') ? 1 : -1;
            current += val;

            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, current);

            if (current < 0) {
                current = 0;
            }
        }

        // If all values were -1 (i.e., all 1s), return -1
        return (maxDiff <= 0) ? -1 : maxDiff;
    }
    
    // Driver method for multiple test cases
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());

        while (T-- > 0) {
            String str = sc.nextLine().trim();
            System.out.println(maximumDifference(str));
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
