# Intuition

To find the longest substring with at most `K` distinct characters, a brute force approach would involve checking all possible substrings, but that would be inefficient for large strings. Instead, we can use a **sliding window** approach with a **HashMap** to track character frequencies within the window. This allows us to efficiently expand and shrink the window while maintaining the constraint of at most `K` distinct characters.

---

# Approach

* Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, representing the window.
* Use a `HashMap` to keep track of character counts within the current window.
* Move `end` forward to expand the window and add characters.
* If the number of distinct characters exceeds `K`, move `start` forward to shrink the window until the constraint is satisfied.
* At each step, calculate the window length and update the maximum length found so far.

---

# Complexity

* **Time complexity:**
  $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the input string. Each character is processed at most twice (once added, once removed).

* **Space complexity:**
  $O(k)$ where $k$ is the number of distinct characters in the window (at most 26 for lowercase English letters).

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static int kDistinctChars(int k, String str) {
        if (str == null || str.length() == 0 || k == 0) return 0;

        Map<Character, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLen = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < str.length(); end++) {
            char endChar = str.charAt(end);
            freqMap.put(endChar, freqMap.getOrDefault(endChar, 0) + 1);

            while (freqMap.size() > k) {
                char startChar = str.charAt(start);
                freqMap.put(startChar, freqMap.get(startChar) - 1);
                if (freqMap.get(startChar) == 0) {
                    freqMap.remove(startChar);
                }
                start++;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
